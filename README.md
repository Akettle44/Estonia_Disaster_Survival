# Who survived the MS Estonia?

The MS Estonia sank in the Baltic Sea in 1994. Unfortunately, there were only 137 survivors of the 989 people on board.
Although tragic, there exists a question of what led those 137 to survive. Did it have to do with their age, gender, or what type of passenger they were? Since shipwrecks are typically self contained, (the dataset provides the necessary data needed to make a prediction), this python script explores how different machine learning algorithms predict the fates of the passengers and crew.
